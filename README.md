# New Orleans Flood Mapping Project (Post Hurricane Data Analysis)


## Introduction

For our project we will examine hurricane flooding in New Orleans. New Orleans is located just off of the Gulf of Mexico, a tropical storm generating body of water. Due to New Orleans location, and its general topography being relatively low with some areas below sea level, it is very vulnerable to hurricanes. In 2005, the city was hit by Hurricane Katrina, (facts here, discuss displacement and destruction). With the onset of global warming causing more extreme weather events around the world, it becomes increasingly important to equip cities like New Orleans with tools to mitigate and respond to these natural disasters which may become more frequent and intense with time. Using our skills as cartographers, we aim to examine the city and the risk posed by future hurricanes to provide a tool for potential damage mitigation and emergency response development.

(Add potential positive/negative impacts)

The intended audience of the project are residents of the area, and also any emergency responding groups. City and state offices and policy-makers. Weather watchers

## Data Sources

### Definite:

* [Highway access](https://uw.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9c18cd35071d43afb96f0eb30901138f) - for use in evacuation map

* Nola Hurricane water level increase and flood data - for developing risk zone levels

* SRTM elevation data - for use in applying flood risk zones to New Orleans

* Nola land use permit data - for identifying properties

### Potential:

* Landsat satellite imagery - for damage map, comparisons between before/after hurricanes

* [Nola neighborhood boundaries](https://data.nola.gov/Geographic-Base-Layers/Neighborhood-Statistical-Areas/c2j2-5qdf)
