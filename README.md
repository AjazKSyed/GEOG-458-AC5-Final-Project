# New Orleans Flood Mapping Project (Post Hurricane Data Analysis)


## Introduction

&emsp?For our project we will examine hurricane flooding in New Orleans. New Orleans is located just off of the Gulf of Mexico, a tropical storm generating body of water. Due to New Orleans location, and its general topography being relatively low with some areas below sea level, it is very vulnerable to hurricanes. In 2005, the city was hit by Hurricane Katrina, (facts here, discuss displacement and destruction). With the onset of global warming causing more extreme weather events around the world, it becomes increasingly important to equip cities like New Orleans with tools to mitigate and respond to these natural disasters which may become more frequent and intense with time. Using our skills as cartographers, we aim to examine the city and the risk posed by future hurricanes to provide a tool for potential damage mitigation and emergency response development.

&emsp?The intended audience of the project are residents of the area, and also any emergency responding groups. City and state offices and policy-makers are likewise an important audience as a powerful agent in enacting fiscally sourced change such as infrastructure development.

&emsp?Positive impacts of the project are better preparing residents of New Orleans for future hurricanes, as well as giving policy-makers and emergency responders better tools to understand the nature of hurricanes and flooding in New Orleans to better protect the population and reduce damage and risk to public safety. Impacts could also include the development of new infrastructure to better aid in emergency situations.
Negative impacts could include policy-makers choosing to invest less in zones deemed at high risk for flooding, which could worsen socio-economic disparities in the city and put lives at greater risk. We could attempt to avoid this by emphasizing the need to invest in higher risk zones to bring down overall risk in the city.
The intended audience of the project are residents of the area, and also any emergency responding groups. City and state offices and policy-makers. Weather watchers

### Definite:

* [Highway access](https://uw.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9c18cd35071d43afb96f0eb30901138f) - for use in evacuation map

* Nola Hurricane water level increase and flood data - for developing risk zone levels

* SRTM elevation data - for use in applying flood risk zones to New Orleans (assets)

* New Orleans lot data - for development of flood risk map, sourced from [New Orleans Open Data](https://data.nola.gov/dataset/Lots/m5br-772y) (assets)

### Potential:

* Landsat satellite imagery - for damage map, comparisons between before/after hurricanes

* [Nola neighborhood boundaries](https://data.nola.gov/Geographic-Base-Layers/Neighborhood-Statistical-Areas/c2j2-5qdf) - potential neighborhood analysis
